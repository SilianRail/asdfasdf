# MenuMap
**MenuMap** is a web application project that uses restaurant/dish curation and maps to empower people who may have felt restricted in their diets to expand and experience foreign cuisines and support businesses near them. 

MenuMap caters to a diverse user base, from students on a budget to adventurous eaters looking for a great recommendation. The app will take inputs from the user such as desired price range, type of cuisine and dietary restrictions to filter nearby restaurants and display the choices on an interactive map.

## Tech Stack
### <img src=./src/assets/HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg-2.png  width="20" height="20"> HTML
Self-explanatory

### <img src=./src/assets/CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg-2.png width="20" height="20"> CSS (Tailwind)
We can simply embed tailwind components into HTML classes; no need to spend time writing CSS. Tailwind also provides consistency in terms of visual design.

### <img src=./src/assets/JavaScript-logo.png width="20" height="20"> JavaScript (React)
 Collectively, we are most familiar with React. It is also an industry staple, therefore it is good to practice. React also has a lot of support in the open-source market.

Testing:

Mocha Reason: Very lightweight because we only need to use the test runner. If we need additional library dependencies, we can simply integrate them accordingly.

CICD:

Github Actions Reason: We plan on hosting on Github Pages, so for simplicity we want to avoid diverging away from a CI/CD platform away from Github.

Hosting:

Github Pages Reason: As a collective, we are most familiar with client-side hosting using Github Pages.
